// One camera from the top of the page to the download. The printed laptop in
// the hero stays put as its words fade away, turns square on and pushes in
// until its screen is the window (js/hero.js, `setDive`). Over the last of
// that push its screen comes on: the recorded desktop, laid exactly on the
// printed screen wherever the dive has it, lit through a halftone of the
// print's own pitch whose dots swell until they close, so the print turns
// into the screen. The film section pins with the desktop filling the window,
// the notch hanging from its top, and from there the camera follows the
// footage rather than the scroll: in on the player as the pointer rises to
// it, held there through every gesture, back out to the whole desktop as the
// player goes into the notch. Scrolling on, the words go, the player goes back
// into the notch, and the camera carries the desktop's notch in and down onto
// the band's — the download link — at the window's centre. The download is
// drawn up under the desktop the whole way, its notch wherever the camera has
// the desktop's, so above the desktop's top edge is the band's bezel and the
// heading over it. As it lands, the desktop goes back to print the way it
// came, through the halftone, its dots shrinking evenly until they are gone,
// so the recorded menu bar becomes the printed one in place and the idle
// notch becomes the link.
//
// The desktop is a still of the take's own first frame and the footage covers
// only the part of it that moves: the player under the notch and the
// pointer's whole way to it, where the take recorded them. The footage has
// two pixels a point, and the camera draws a point at no more than 1.8 CSS
// pixels: close enough to be a push in, and on a Retina display the type in
// it is drawn at most 1.8 times as large as it was shot, which stays crisp.
//
// Scroll here is counted in window heights past the pin, so the settle and
// the words take the same scroll on every window, however tall the film is.
