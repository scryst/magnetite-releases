//
// The input is not synthesised. `REAL_LEVELS` is 240 frames captured from the
// app's own audio tap, replayed at the 30 Hz it was captured at and stepped
// twice apiece at 60 — which is what the app does with them, and what this file
// spent its whole existence not doing. It said 60 Hz here, indexed at 60 Hz
// below, and played eight seconds of music in four. See `CAPTURE_HZ`. The ink
// is displaced by the same numbers that displace it on the machine, at the same
// pace; the one deliberate difference is the low pass, and `SMOOTH_TAU` says
// why a page five times the size of a menu bar needs one.

/**
 * The rate the capture was TAKEN at, which is not the rate the page draws at.
 *
 * This was 60, and 60 was wrong. `AudioLevels.swift` pumps its read loop on
 * `Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(33))` — the class comment beside it says "30
 * times a second" and the tap's own says "roughly 30 times a second" — so the
 * `[levels]` lines that `NOTCH_AUDIO_DEBUG` prints, which are byte-for-byte the
 * format of `Resources/real-levels.txt`, arrive at 30Hz. The commit that added
 * the capture (cefd7f7) says so outright: "the clock runs at 60Hz while levels
 * arrive at 30, so every second step sees a delta of exactly zero", and
 * `tools/fluidcheck.swift` steps each captured frame TWICE for that reason. The
 * pump was already 33ms at that commit, so this was never 60.
 *
 * Indexing at 60 played eight seconds of music in four. Everything downstream
 * inherited it: the loop period was reported as 3.567s and is 7.133s, the
 * entrance landed at 1.72s instead of the 3.43s of the music it claims to be
 * caused by, and `SMOOTH_TAU` was added below to quiet a "jitter" that was the
 * double speed. The page's own header said the ink is "displaced by the same
 * numbers that displace it on the machine", and it was displaced by the same
 * numbers at twice the pace.
 *
 * `theCaptureIsReplayedAtItsOwnRate` reads the pump interval out of
 * AudioLevels.swift and fails if these two ever disagree again.

 * one shown that it never does. This advances a seeded sim through the app's
 * own capture to a frame with the surface standing displaced and paints that,
 * once.
 *
 * Chosen by rendering candidates and looking at them — and looked at again once
 * the replay's cadence was corrected, because the first pass chose off a sim
 * stepped ONCE per captured frame, which is not the sequence the loop below
 * integrates. 110 survived that second look: across the capture it still
 * carries a wave train along its lower edge with a tapered fall at each end,
 * where its neighbours give up one or the other.
 *
 * The margin is small, and the reason is `reduceMotion` on the sim: Geometry's
 * `reducedTravel` caps the excursion, so nothing in this capture crowns
 * dramatically under the preference. What the choice buys is an edge that
 * undulates and ends that taper instead of the flat pill — not a peak.

 * number", and both halves were wrong: the capture is 30Hz, and once it is
 * indexed at 30 each frame is held for two steps, so half the steps are a new
 * number and the other half are the same one. The chatter it was added to quiet
 * was the double speed. That would make this a compensation for a bug that has
 * since been fixed, and the honest move looked like deleting it.
 *
 * It is not, and the reason is scale. The hero draws the liquid at three times
 * the machine's own size, so a point of travel is several pixels on the page,
 * and every sheet is screened: a surface that moves a dot pitch per step makes
 * the dots crawl. The way to measure it is the furthest any point of the
 * outline moves between one step and the next, in page pixels, over the whole
 * capture, with and without this pass. The app does not need this because the
 * app is small and unscreened.
 *
 * So it stays, as a first-order low pass on the levels going in — the same
 * numbers, arriving less abruptly. Peaks still break; they stop chattering. The
 * physics below it is untouched, and this is the one place the page is
 * knowingly not the app: `theReplayIsSteppedLikeTheApp` proves the port under
 * the app's cadence with the levels raw, and then the page smooths them.

  // run at 60Hz, and no reading of it under the true 30Hz comes back under
  // 0.48. Eight variants were tried — smoothed and raw, the index taken from
  // elapsed time and from a held count — and the whole 30Hz family lands
